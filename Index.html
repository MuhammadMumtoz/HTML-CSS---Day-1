    <h1 style="font-family:Georgia;">Top 5 Most Popular Participation Sports In The World</h1>
    <h3 style="font-family:Cambria;">In need of some sporting inspiration? Here are the 5 most popular participation sports in the world to pick from.</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans';">Although it is quite difficult to estimate exact participation numbers for sports around the world, 
        it is possible to give a general idea of some of the most participated sports using available research,
         although we appreciate that the list is open to debate.</p>
    <h3 style="background-color:aqua; text-align:center; border: 2px solid Tomato; font-family: Cambria;">1. Soccer/Football</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans';">Few things can rival <a href="https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/sports-activities/article-listing/?filter=footballsoccer&page=1">football</a>
         as a spectator sport and this is also matched by the number of people who participate in the sport,
         be it at grassroots level, 5-a-side leagues or simply playing for fun with friends.
         In the last global census undertaken by the sports governing body FIFA,
         it was estimated that there are 265 million people who play the sport along with more than 5 million referees,
         which equates to 4% of the world’s population.</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans';">The Federation of International Basketball Associations (FIBA) estimates that a minimum of 450 million
         people play the sport around the world, be it recreationally or through structured competitions. 
         Legendary figures in the world of basketball such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, 
         have aided the rise in global popularity of the sport from its American roots.</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans';">Historically baseball was more popular in America than anywhere else in the world but the sport is now becoming 
        increasingly popular in other countries such as Japan. <a href="https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/sports-activities/article/introduction-to-softball/">Softball</a>
          is the female version of the game, and it is estimated
         by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) that 65 million people play either baseball or softball in over
          140 countries.</p>
